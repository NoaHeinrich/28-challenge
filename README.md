## Part 2 Questions

- How would you make this communication more secure?
    - I would have the API require an API key that would be generated by the administrator.
- How would you handle the remote URL being temporarily unavailable?
    - I would still allow the users to sign up and be saved to the database, and message to them that they have not been assigned a doctor yet, but will be soon. Afterwards, I could automate having users with unassigned doctors to contact the URL at a later time.
- How would you cover this with tests?
    - I would use an external library like `webmock` to stub the HTTP request. This would allow me to get a predefined API response without actually contacting the API itself, which would unneccessarily slow down testing, and possibly cause confusion on the other end of the API.

## Part 3

If some products can't be offered in some states, I would need to change the structure of my database. Products and States would have a many-to-many relationship, as a State can have many Products available, and a Product can be available in many States. I would need to create a join table, perhaps called StateProducts, which would have state_id and product_id columns. Afterwards, I could prevent a user from selecting products that are not available in their state using JavaScript, either by preventing submission like I did with states that aren't supported, or by rendering the dropdown of medications after a state has been selected.
